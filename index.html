<h2> About me </h2>
<div class="container-box">

<p>I am a third year Master's student in Computer Science department at <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>. Iâ€™m working on representation learning for medical images under the dual supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/">Prof. Doina Precup</a> and <a href="https://cim.mcgill.ca/~arbel">Prof. Tal Arbel</a>. I'm affliated with <a href="https://mila.quebec/">Mila</a> and <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~pvg/">Probabilistic Vision Group</a> at McGill University. My current research work is mostly in the application of deep learning, transfer learning and computer vision in the field of medical imaging. </p>

<p> Going forward, I'm interested in developing models that can continually adapt to new stream of data while retaining the learning from old ones. This problem is specifically called <b>Continual/Lifelong learning </b>. Humans learn continually throughtout their lives without catastrophically forgetting the past events. I believe that the machines should be able to do the same. I also think that one of the most promising ways in order to do that is understanding how the human mind works. Then, we can leverage this knowledge to drive the representation in deep networks. </p> 

<p>Previously, I completed my bachelor's in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.igdtuw.ac.in/">Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, Delhi</a> where I worked with <a href="https://rishabhkaushal.github.io/">Prof. Rishabh Kaushal</a> on developing an algorithm for load balancing and scheduling jobs on the cloud.</p>
